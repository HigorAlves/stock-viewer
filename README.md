# Run the project

> Before all install dependencies

### Client (NEXT.JS)

To run the client side project just need to run `yarn client:dev` or `yarn client:start`

### Mobile (REACT NATIVE)

First start the metro bundler with `yarn mobile:start` then just run `yarn mobile:android`

> PS: if you get an error saying that cannot find `@jetpack/store` just create a folder inside `node_modules` called `@jepack` then copy and paste the folder named `store` inside `shared`.
